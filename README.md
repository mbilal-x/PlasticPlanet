## Introduction

Welcome to the repository of Plastic Planet Website, a project developed as a part of my ICT course. In this project, I was introduced to HTML and CSS for the first time. It was an intense journey of 15 days, involving countless tutorials and code-alongs to create a website addressing the critical environmental issue of ocean pollution and waste dumping.

I am particularly proud of this project because I designed it entirely by myself, utilizing my creative skills in Photoshop to incorporate illustrative images and backgrounds. The result is a visually engaging and impactful website that reflects the severity of the issue at hand.

## Project Overview

The Plastic Planet Website is a static website with five main pages: Home, Mission, About, Contact, and Login. The primary focus of the website is to raise awareness about ocean pollution and the hazards of plastic waste dumping. By creating this website, I aimed to contribute to the collective effort of preserving our oceans and promoting a cleaner environment.

## Remarks and Closing

Developing the Plastic Planet Website was an enriching experience, as it allowed me to apply my newly acquired HTML and CSS skills to address a critical environmental issue. The creative freedom in designing the website using Photoshop illustrations made it even more special to me.

While the website is not responsive, I take pride in its visual appeal and the message it conveys. My hope is that it creates awareness about ocean pollution and motivates visitors to take action in preserving our planet.
