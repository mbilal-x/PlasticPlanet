<h2>Plastic in our Oceans</h2>
<p>
We all use plastic. Its convienent right. But is it worth it?
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>
  We are drowning in our plastic.
</p>
<p>
	The extremely useful material plastic that we use every day, is sadly, slowly destroying our beloved planet. 
</p>
<p>
	Most of the plastic we use, is only used once in its entire lifetime. The average time a pastic bag is actually used is about 12 minutes. This same plastic bag lives upto 500 to a 1000 years. shocking right?
</p>
<p>
	This plastic waste find its way to the oceans, fresh water reservoirs underground and the soil in the form of micro-plastics. 
	<br>
	Already almost every marine species in the ocean has consumed and continues to consume these toxins. It is not only the marine life that is effected, but also plants, and animals which consume these plants also take in these toxins.
	<br>
	<br>
	Of course, us human beings are no exception.
	<br> 
	<br>
	Just think about it, how many disposable plastic items do you use on daily basis? where do these items go when they have served their purpose, and are no longer usable or needed?
</p>
	<p>
	I am no expert on this topic, nor do I claim to be one. I speak as just another average citizen of this planet. I just want to share my thoughts and hopefully meet like minded people through this platform.
	</p>
	<p>We don't have to start by changing the system. we can start right here, with ourselves. </p>
